# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: _SQL Injection_________________
A user can use SQLI on the Salesperson page via URL parameters by requesting salesperson.php?id=' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: _Cross Site Scripting_________________
The user can inject JavaScript code into the Contact page by entering <script>alert('Jayden found the XSS!');</script> into either the name or feedback input boxes. When the admin tries to go to Staff Area > Feedback, the script runs as the page loads.

Vulnerability #2: ____Username Enumeration______________
The Login page displays an error message in bolded text if the username is correct and an error message in plain text if the username is incorrect.
